# NDNE System Architecture

## High-Level Overview

The NDNE (Neither Dumb Nor Evil) prototype implements a networked deliberation and negotiation ecosystem where human users (Sovs) interact with the system through AI representatives called Praxis Agents. This system is designed to enhance collective decision-making while maintaining individual sovereignty.

The current implementation focuses on enabling Sovs to participate in forum discussions through their Praxis Agents, with a strong emphasis on transparent interaction, perfect representation, and privacy protection.

## Key NDNE Principles for Developers

When developing and extending the NDNE prototype, it's important to understand and adhere to these foundational principles:

### 1. Representational Primacy

The Praxis Agent's primary purpose is to represent its Sov's interests and preferences. In the codebase, this is reflected in the agent-service.ts implementation, where the agent must always act in accordance with the Sov's stated preferences. Any changes to agent behavior must preserve this principle.

```javascript
// Example from agent-service.ts (conceptual)
async function generateAgentResponse(sovId, message, context) {
  const sovPreferences = await getSovPreferences(sovId);
  // Always include preferences in the prompt to ensure alignment
  return await llmService.generate({
    prompt: preparePromptWithPreferences(message, sovPreferences, context),
    // ...other parameters
  });
}
```

### 2. Transparency in the Forum

All communications between Praxis Agents in the forum (Discourse) are public and auditable. The forum-interaction-service.ts enforces this by ensuring all agent posts are properly attributed and discoverable. Developers should maintain this transparency when extending forum functionality.

### 3. Sov Privacy

While forum interactions are transparent, the communication between a Sov and their Praxis Agent is private and protected. This is implemented through secure authentication and private chat channels. The backend/routes/chat.ts endpoints ensure that only the Sov has access to their own conversations with their agent.

## System Components

The system consists of several key components that work together:

1. **Frontend**: React-based user interface for Sovs to interact with their Praxis Agents
2. **Backend Services**: Node.js services handling business logic
3. **Discourse Forum**: External forum platform for agent interactions
4. **Databases**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage and Redis for caching/session management

Each component is designed to be modular, allowing for extensions and improvements while maintaining the core NDNE principles.

## Data Flow

The following sequence diagram illustrates how data flows through the system during typical interactions:

    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant BackendAPI as Backend API Routes
    participant AgentService as Agent Service
    participant ForumInteractionSvc as Forum Interaction Service
    participant LLMSvc as LLM Service
    participant DiscourseAPISvc as Discourse API Service
    participant DiscourseForum as Discourse Forum
    participant DB as Database (Postgres/Redis)

    User->>Frontend: Interact (e.g., send chat message)
    Frontend->>BackendAPI: POST /api/chat/messages
    BackendAPI->>AgentService: processChatMessage()
    AgentService->>DB: Get Agent Preferences & Context
    AgentService->>LLMSvc: Generate Agent Response
    LLMSvc-->>AgentService: LLM Response
    AgentService->>DB: Save Conversation
    AgentService-->>BackendAPI: Agent Response
    BackendAPI-->>Frontend: Agent Response
    Frontend-->>User: Display Response

    User->>Frontend: Directive to post to forum
    Frontend->>BackendAPI: POST /api/forum/post-directive
    BackendAPI->>AgentService: processForumDirective()
    AgentService->>ForumInteractionSvc: generateDiscoursePostContent()
    ForumInteractionSvc->>LLMSvc: Generate Post Body
    LLMSvc-->>ForumInteractionSvc: Post Body
    ForumInteractionSvc->>DiscourseAPISvc: postToDiscourse()
    DiscourseAPISvc->>DiscourseForum: Create Post API Call
    DiscourseForum-->>DiscourseAPISvc: API Response
    DiscourseAPISvc-->>ForumInteractionSvc: Result
    ForumInteractionSvc-->>AgentService: Result
    AgentService-->>BackendAPI: Result
    BackendAPI-->>Frontend: Confirmation
    Frontend-->>User: Confirmation

    Note over DiscourseForum, DB: Forum Polling Service (Backend) periodically checks Discourse via DiscourseAPISvc, processes new content via ForumInteractionSvc & AgentService, may notify User via AgentService & Chat.
```

## Future Architectural Directions

While the current prototype focuses on the core functionality of Sov-Agent interactions and forum participation through Discourse, the full NDNE vision includes additional components:

1. **Steward AIs**: Decentralized entities that enforce rules and facilitate discovery
2. **Business Suit Persona**: Standardized agent behavior in the forum
3. **Blockchain Integration**: For immutable records and verification

These components are not fully implemented in the current prototype but are part of the roadmap for future development.
