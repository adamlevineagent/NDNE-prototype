# Testing Log - Onboarding Process

## Date: 4/23/2025
## Tester: Roo

## Issues Found

### 1. Chat Interface Response Issues
- **Description**: When providing responses in the onboarding chat interface, the agent sometimes doesn't properly process or respond to user input.
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Start onboarding process
  2. Answer first question about decision-making preferences
  3. Attempt to answer the follow-up question about preferences prioritization
  4. Agent doesn't acknowledge or process the second response 
- **Expected Behavior**: Agent should acknowledge each response and continue with appropriate follow-up questions.
- **Actual Behavior**: Agent gets stuck waiting for a response even after providing one.

### 2. Onboarding Flow Logic Issues
- **Description**: The onboarding process is not properly progressing through defined stages.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Complete several exchanges in the onboarding chat.
- **Expected Behavior**: Agent should progress through initial, preferences, priorities, and confirmation stages.
- **Actual Behavior**: Stage progression logic is simplistic and not properly integrated with the chat interface.

### 3. Onboarding Prompts Need Improvement
- **Description**: The system prompt for onboarding contains placeholder text.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Review backend/src/services/prompt-templates/onboarding-prompts.ts file.
- **Expected Behavior**: Clear, specific prompts for the agent to follow during onboarding.
- **Actual Behavior**: Contains placeholder text "[list of required preferences]" which may cause confusion.

### 4. Chat Route Not Using Onboarding-Specific Logic
- **Description**: The chat route is using a generic LLM call rather than the specialized onboarding chat function.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Review the POST /api/chat/messages route handler.
- **Expected Behavior**: Should use conductOnboardingChat for onboarding messages.
- **Actual Behavior**: Uses generic LLM call that doesn't handle onboarding stages.

## Fixes Required

1. Update the chat route to use conductOnboardingChat for messages with isOnboarding metadata
2. Enhance onboarding prompts to remove placeholders and provide clear guidance
3. Fix the ChatInterface component to properly handle message processing and errors
4. Improve the progression logic in the conductOnboardingChat function
