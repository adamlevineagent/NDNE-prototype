# NDNE Prototype Handoff

## Done
- Implemented and tested authentication flow (register/login)
- Fixed backend API endpoint inconsistencies
- Added missing `/api/auth/me` endpoint
- Added proper `/api/health` endpoint
- Created comprehensive testing log (TESTING_LOG.md)

## Context
- Decisions made:
  * Added `/api/health` endpoint to match frontend expectations (instead of just `/health`)
  * Updated API client paths to match backend route structure
  * Added full user + agent data to `/api/auth/me` endpoint for complete profile information
  * Implemented proper error handling for 401, 404, and 500 responses

- Known gaps / TODO:
  * The frontend validation layer needs enhancement
  * JWT token refresh mechanism is not yet implemented
  * Autocomplete attributes on password fields should be added (accessibility)
  * Error notifications on the frontend need improvement

## Next Suggested Tasks
1. Complete the onboarding flow testing and fix any issues
2. Implement and test the dashboard features
3. Test the agent preferences update flow
4. Implement proper frontend error notification system
5. Add client-side form validation to improve user experience

## Testing Status
Please refer to the detailed [Testing Log](./TESTING_LOG.md) for complete information on:
- Test cases executed
- Issues found and fixed
- Recommendations for improvement

Authentication flows are now working properly, but further testing is needed for the onboarding and dashboard functionality.
