Here’s a first-cut “cold-start” package of live local issues, sample proposals, and contrasting citizen viewpoints you can drop straight into NDNE for Grants Pass, OR. I pulled each topic from very recent council agendas, agency press releases, or reputable Oregon news outlets so the material feels current and test-worthy.

1 - Why these topics?
Grants Pass is simultaneously wrestling with big-ticket infrastructure costs (a cancelled $50 million water-plant grant), the fallout of its landmark Supreme Court homelessness case, wildfire-driven resiliency work, and tourism-tax funding debates—all of which produce clear, opinionated camps in town. Together they give us a solid spectrum of “values collisions” to probe during onboarding.

2 - Seed proposals & the opinions they spark
A. Water-Treatment Plant Funding Gap
Draft proposal: Issue a 25-year municipal revenue bond and raise residential water rates 12 % to close the $50 M shortfall after FEMA’s BRIC grant was cancelled.
Typical stances

Infrastructure-first residents: “Safe water is non-negotiable; bite the bullet now.”

Fixed-income seniors: “12 % is steep—phase it or find state help.”

Small-business owners: Worry about pass-through cost hikes to restaurants & breweries.
Onboarding probe: “If closing a funding gap means your monthly bill rises ~$6, do you prefer: (a) pay now, (b) slower phased hike, (c) seek new state/federal grants even if construction is delayed)?”

B. Downtown Homeless “Resting Sites” Expansion
Draft proposal: Approve two adjacent parking-lot campsites, bringing total capacity to 150 tents, as ordered by the court.
Typical stances

Downtown retail: Fears customer flight; supports dispersing camps.

Service-provider NGOs: Support concentrated sites for easier outreach.

Libertarian voters: Prefer enforcing anti-camping laws post-Johnson decision. 
supremecourt.gov

Onboarding probe: “Which matters more: reducing sidewalk camping city-wide or spreading managed sites across neighborhoods to share impacts?”

C. Wildfire-Risk Utility Surcharge
Draft proposal: Endorse Pacific Power’s plan to add a temporary $2/month surcharge to speed undergrounding and covered-conductor projects (500 mi planned, 100 mi in 2025).
Typical stances

Fire-concerned homeowners: Strongly support—cheaper than losing a home.

Low-income advocates: Want income-based credits first.

Outdoor recreation business: Favor, emphasize tourism reliability.

Onboarding probe: “Would you accept a dedicated $2 utility fee if it demonstrably cut local wildfire ignition risk by 30 %?”

D. Transportation System Plan (TSP) Priority Package
Draft proposal: Adopt the TSP’s “Active Streets” scenario, reallocating $5 M from road-widening to bike & sidewalk links near two I-5 interchanges.
Typical stances

Cyclists & students: Support—safer routes to school.

Commuter drivers: Oppose—predict worse congestion.

Climate-action group: Insist on even bolder mode-shift targets.

Onboarding probe: “Rank these in order of importance for new transportation dollars: smoother car traffic, safer bike/walk routes, expanded city bus service.”

E. Cannabis Compliance Reform
Draft proposal: Cut Josephine County’s marijuana “certificate of compliance” fee from $500 to $250, but add mandatory water-use reporting to address Rogue River withdrawals.
Typical stances

Licensed growers: Back lower fees, balk at extra paperwork.

Irrigation district: Wants strict usage audits.

Public-health coalition: Push for stronger odor-control rules instead.

Onboarding probe: “When regulating local cannabis farms, is affordability for legal growers or tight water-use oversight more important to you?”

F. Lodging-Tax Reallocation
Draft proposal: Shift 10 % of the city’s 12 % Transient Lodging Tax from tourism marketing to police & fire to avoid a separate levy hike.
Typical stances

Hotel/restaurant owners: Oppose—fear losing promotional dollars.

Public-safety supporters: Note voters renew levies every few years anyway—prefer stable base funding.

Arts & tourism board: Offer compromise—sunset clause after three years.

Onboarding probe: “If you had $100 of lodging-tax revenue, how much would you direct to tourism promotion vs. public safety?”
