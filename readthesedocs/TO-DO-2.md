# Implementing Proposal & Negotiation Integration
Goal: Connect completed negotiations to the proposal system and allow user feedback on agent performance.

## Completed Implementation Tasks:

### Database Changes:
- ✅ Created `NegotiationFeedback` model in schema.prisma for storing user feedback
- ✅ Set up @@unique constraint to prevent duplicate feedback
- ✅ Added proper relations to Agent and NegotiationSession
- ✅ Created migration file (20250425102800_add_negotiation_feedback)

### Negotiation-to-Proposal Service:
- ✅ Created `negotiation-to-proposal.ts` service implementing:
  - `createProposalFromNegotiation(negotiationId)` function:
    - Fetches negotiation session with messages
    - Verifies consensus was reached
    - Extracts negotiation metadata
    - Generates proposal title and description using LLM
    - Creates a new formal proposal with appropriate fields

### API Endpoints:
- ✅ Added POST `/api/negotiations/:id/propose` to create proposals from negotiations
- ✅ Added feedback endpoints:
  - POST `/api/feedback/negotiation/:negotiationId` - Submit feedback
  - GET `/api/feedback/negotiation/:negotiationId` - Get feedback for a negotiation
  - GET `/api/feedback/agent/:agentId` - Get all feedback for an agent

### Feedback System:
- ✅ Created `feedback-service.ts` implementing:
  - `processFeedback()` for storing and updating feedback
  - `updateAgentFromFeedback()` to adjust agent alignment score based on feedback
  - `getFeedback()` for retrieving feedback records

### Frontend Components:
- ✅ Created `NegotiationFeedback.tsx` component for rating agent performance:
  - 1-5 star rating system for overall performance
  - 1-5 star rating for representation accuracy
  - Comment field for detailed feedback
  - Handling for updating existing feedback
- ✅ Created `NegotiationHistory.tsx` to display negotiation messages in read-only mode:
  - Shows negotiation metadata (topic, status, participants)
  - Displays all messages with agent names and timestamps
  - Shows reactions on each message
- ✅ Enhanced `ProposalDetail.tsx` to:
  - Display negotiation summary for proposals from negotiations
  - Integrate the feedback component
  - Show negotiation history in read-only mode
  - Add CSS styling for improved user experience

### Server Configuration:
- ✅ Updated `index.ts` to include new routes and middleware

## Key Implementation Highlights:

1. **Bidirectional Integration**
   - Negotiations can be converted into formal proposals
   - Proposals display their negotiation history
   - Negotiations reference proposals they generate

2. **Feedback Loop**
   - Users can rate agent performance in negotiations
   - Feedback directly impacts agent alignment scores
   - Historical feedback trends are tracked in agent knowledge

3. **Enhanced UI/UX**
   - Clean, organized display of negotiation history
   - Intuitive feedback interface with star ratings
   - Clear visualization of negotiation status and summary

4. **Data Flow**
   - Frontend components → API endpoints → Service layer → Database
   - LLM summarization for human-friendly proposal generation
   - Structured data storage with proper relations
