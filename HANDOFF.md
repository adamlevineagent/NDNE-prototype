# NDNE Prototype Handoff Document

## Context
This document summarizes the current state of the NDNE prototype project, recent work completed, and remaining tasks to guide the next developer(s) in continuing development and testing.

## Development Environment Setup
- **Docker**: Required for running the PostgreSQL and Redis services
  - Ensure Docker daemon is running before starting the application
  - Docker containers are configured in `docker-compose.yml`
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 (runs in Docker container)
- **Redis**: Version 7 (runs in Docker container)
- **Start/Stop Scripts**: Use `./scripts/start-servers.sh` and `./scripts/stop-servers.sh`

## Recent Work Completed
- Implemented full LLM integration with OpenRouter in the agent-service module.
- Integrated agent-service functions with backend routes for proposals, votes, feedback, and digest generation.
- Created frontend components for ProposalList, ProposalDetail, NewProposalForm, and SettingsPage.
- Implemented backend routes for comment creation and integrated with agent-service.
- Added comprehensive audit document `NDNE_CANONICAL_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md` capturing all remaining work.
- Fixed CORS issues and improved API client usage in frontend.
- Added start and stop server scripts for development convenience.
- Established test coverage for agent-service and comment tone linting.
- **Enhanced veto/undo functionality** in DashboardPage.tsx with:
  - Added timeout handling (15-second timeout)
  - Improved error handling with user-friendly feedback messages
  - Implemented React state-based UI updates instead of full page reloads
  - Added loading indicators during API calls
  - Improved concurrent request handling
- **Fixed database connection issues**:
  - Added better error handling in backend routes
  - Ensured proper database connectivity checks
  - Improved logging for database-related errors

## Recently Fixed Issues
- **Database Connection Error**: Fixed issue where the backend couldn't connect to PostgreSQL database. This was occurring because Docker wasn't running. The application now properly logs database connection failures.
- **Veto Functionality**: Enhanced the implementation to include better error handling, timeout management, and UI feedback. Previously, veto actions could hang indefinitely and forced page reloads.

## Remaining Tasks
- Complete proposal comments interactive features (add/edit/delete).
- Implement JWT refresh mechanism for authentication.
- Improve error handling and global notification system.
- Complete frontend polish: responsive design, visual consistency, accessibility.
- Expand test coverage: API endpoints, end-to-end flows, performance, security.
- Finalize documentation: README, deployment instructions, environment setup.
- Prepare demo data and seed scripts for testing.
- Implement admin functions for user management and system monitoring.

## Development Practices
- Follow progressive enhancement: implement minimal viable features first, then polish.
- Maintain continuous testing and update `TESTING_LOG.md` with results.
- Use simulation modes to safely test agent autonomy levels.
- Prioritize user sovereignty and transparency in all features.
- Coordinate parallel development for core features, settings, and veto functionality.

## Troubleshooting
- **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure Docker is running, and containers for PostgreSQL and Redis are started. Use `docker ps` to verify.
- **Login Failures**: Check database connection in backend logs. If you see "Database connection failed", start Docker containers with `docker-compose up -d postgres redis`.
- **Frontend API Errors**: Verify backend is running and accessible at localhost:4000. Check network tab in browser dev tools for specific error responses.

## Next Steps
- Review the audit document `NDNE_CANONICAL_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md` for detailed task list.
- Prioritize and schedule remaining work based on audit priorities.
- Continue implementation and testing until all critical features are complete.
- Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of all major user flows:
  - User registration and login
  - Proposal creation and management
  - Voting and commenting
  - Agent preferences configuration
  - Veto/undo functionality
