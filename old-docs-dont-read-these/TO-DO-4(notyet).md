Completing Dashboard UI/UX & Integration
Goal: Finalize the three-tab dashboard design, ensure seamless integration, implement responsiveness, and perform thorough testing.

Relevant Files:

frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx
frontend/src/components/dashboard/* (All tab components)
frontend/src/components/AgentChatPanel.tsx
frontend/src/context/DashboardContext.tsx
frontend/src/hooks/useChatContext.tsx
Associated CSS files (*.css)
Cypress tests (frontend/cypress/e2e/*)
Implementation Steps:

Complete Tab Component Logic:
Files: PositionsMatrixTab.tsx, ActivityAuditTab.tsx, ProposalsTab.tsx
Action: Ensure all tabs correctly fetch and display data from the DashboardContext (which in turn uses API calls defined in refreshData). Implement all interactive elements (filters, sorting, buttons) defined in the redesign plan (dashboard_redesign_plan.md, though focusing on code completion as per user instruction). Connect "Discuss" / "Respond" buttons to update the ChatContext and maximize the chat panel (onChatMaximize prop).
Refine Dashboard Layout & Styling (DashboardPage.tsx):
Action: Polish the overall layout, ensuring consistent styling, spacing, and typography across the tab navigation, content area, and status panel. Verify agent color theming is applied consistently.
Action: Ensure the persistent AgentChatPanel integrates smoothly without overlapping or obscuring tab content, especially when maximized.
Implement Mobile Responsiveness:
Action: Review and add/adjust CSS media queries in all dashboard-related stylesheets (DashboardPage.css, tab component CSS, AgentChatPanel.css, IssuesMatrix.css, etc.).
Action: Test layout and usability on various screen sizes (tablet, mobile). Ensure tab navigation, filters, lists, and the chat panel adapt correctly (e.g., stacking elements, using smaller fonts/padding, horizontal scroll for tabs).
Final Integration Testing:
Action: Manually test the complete user flow: Onboarding -> Dashboard -> Navigating Tabs -> Interacting with Issues/Activities/Proposals -> Triggering Chat Context -> Conversing with Agent -> Returning to Tab.
Action: Verify that context set by one tab (e.g., clicking "Discuss Issue" in Positions Matrix) is correctly reflected in the AgentChatPanel.
Action: Verify that actions taken in the chat (e.g., agent updating an issue stance) are reflected back in the relevant dashboard tab (likely requiring a data refresh triggered via DashboardContext.refreshData).
Expand Test Coverage:
Action: Write comprehensive E2E tests (Cypress) covering dashboard navigation, tab interactions, filtering/sorting, triggering chat from tabs, and verifying data display.
Action: Add unit/integration tests for any complex frontend logic within tab components or context providers.
Key Considerations:

Data Freshness: Implement a clear strategy for refreshing dashboard data (e.g., manual refresh button, periodic polling via DashboardContext.refreshData, or ideally, real-time updates via WebSockets if implemented).
Performance: Profile dashboard loading times and interactions, especially with large lists in the Activity or Proposals tabs. Optimize rendering and data fetching as needed.
User Experience: Ensure clear visual cues, loading states, and error messages provide a smooth user experience.
