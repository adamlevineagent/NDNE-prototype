## Tab 1: Positions Matrix

Enhancing the existing `IssuesMatrix` component to create a more interactive positions management system.

### Key Features:
1. **Default View**: Show only issues where the user has taken positions
2. **Expanded View**: Button to show ALL issues sorted by most recent update
3. **Issue Cards**: Interactive cards with issue details, stance and reasoning
4. **Discussion Trigger**: Each issue card has a button to re-open that issue for discussion with the agent
5. **Update Mechanism**: Agent can update matrix with new information during discussions

### Technical Implementation:
- Enhance `IssuesMatrix` to include filtering capabilities
- Add sorting functionality (by recency, priority, etc.)
- Implement issue discussion trigger that opens the chat panel with context
- Create a mechanism for the agent to update the matrix based on chat outcomes

## Technical Considerations

### 1. State Management
- Use React Context API for global state (current tab, user info, etc.)
- Use Redux for complex state management (issues matrix, activity feed)
- Use component state for UI-specific controls

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Implement virtualized lists for long content (activities, issues)
- Use lazy loading for tab content
- Implement proper memoization for expensive computations
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo and useMemo

### 3. Real-time Updates
- Implement WebSocket connection for immediate notifications
- Use optimistic UI updates with fallback
- Implement efficient delta updates

### 4. Accessibility
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation between tabs
- Use semantic HTML with appropriate ARIA roles
- Implement focus management for modal dialogs and dynamic content
- Provide text alternatives for all visual information

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness
- Design for desktop-first but ensure tablet compatibility
- Use responsive design patterns for layout
- Consider touch interactions for mobile devices
- Implement adaptive chat panel for smaller screens

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness
- Design for desktop-first but ensure tablet compatibility
- Use responsive design patterns for layout
- Consider touch interactions for mobile devices
- Implement adaptive chat panel for smaller screens
- Maintain personalized elements even in constrained layouts

### 6. Personalization
- Retrieve and use the user's name from onboarding throughout the interface
- Maintain consistent, friendly tone across all components
- Provide personalized guidance based on user experience level
- Use the agent's personality to enhance the personalized experience
- Store and respect user preferences for personalization intensity

### 7. Error Handling
- Implement global error boundary
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Create retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Log errors for debugging

### 8. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for tab functionality
- End-to-end tests for critical paths
- Accessibility testing with automated tools

This comprehensive plan provides a roadmap for implementing the three-tab dashboard with interconnections between components. By following the implementation phases, we can deliver a cohesive, intuitive user experience that allows users to effectively manage their positions, review activity, and collaborate on proposals with their agent.

The personalized elements will make the dashboard feel welcoming and tailored to each user, addressing them by name and providing clear guidance throughout their journey. This personal touch will enhance user engagement and make the complex functionality more approachable and friendly.
