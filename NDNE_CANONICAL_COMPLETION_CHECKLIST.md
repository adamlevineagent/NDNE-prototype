# NDNE Prototype: Canonical Completion Checklist Audit

## Purpose
This checklist serves as the canonical audit and completion plan for the NDNE prototype. It consolidates all remaining tasks, including frontend, backend, LLM integration, testing, UX, documentation, and deployment, to achieve full functionality where humans act as sovereigns and their AI agents negotiate autonomously as envisioned.

---

## 1. Frontend Components and Pages

- [ ] Complete Proposal Management Features
  - [ ] ProposalList.tsx: Add filters, pagination, status indicators
  - [ ] ProposalDetail.tsx: Complete comments section, vote threshold progress
  - [ ] NewProposalForm.tsx: Implement creation form with validation and conditional fields
  - [ ] Wire proposal routes in App.tsx
  - [ ] Connect frontend API client with endpoints for proposals, votes, comments
- [ ] Implement Settings Pages
  - [ ] SettingsPage.tsx with tabs for Profile, Agent, Notifications
  - [ ] Connect API client for updating user profile, agent settings, digest preferences
- [ ] Veto/Undo Functionality
  - [ ] Integrate feedback handler in dashboard
  - [ ] Confirmation dialogs and notifications for veto actions
  - [ ] Alignment score recalculation on veto
- [ ] UX Improvements
  - [ ] Form validation with inline errors and ARIA labels
  - [ ] Responsive design fixes for mobile/tablet
  - [ ] Visual consistency: buttons, colors, loading skeletons, transitions
  - [ ] Toast notifications and error boundaries

---

## 2. Backend Routes and API Endpoints

- [ ] Complete proposal API endpoints: create, list, detail, vote, comment
- [ ] Settings API endpoints: update user profile, agent preferences, digest settings
- [ ] Feedback/veto API enhancements
- [ ] Digest system integration with frontend
- [ ] Error handling and consistent response formatting
- [ ] Authentication context integration and token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Admin routes for user management and system monitoring (if applicable)

---

## 3. LLM Agent-Service Integration

- [ ] Complete integration of agent-service with backend routes and jobs
- [ ] Implement retries and fallback strategies for LLM calls
- [ ] Enhance prompt engineering and structured output handling
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting for LLM usage and errors
- [ ] Support simulation modes for agent autonomy levels
- [ ] Ensure secure storage and usage of API keys

---

## 4. Testing Coverage and Gaps

- [ ] Full coverage of veto logic and override scenarios
- [ ] Alignment score calculation tests
- [ ] API tests for all proposal, vote, comment endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end tests for main user flows: registration, onboarding, proposal creation, voting, commenting, veto
- [ ] Performance and security testing (load, concurrency, XSS, CSRF)
- [ ] Integration tests for digest generation and delivery
- [ ] Admin function tests (if implemented)

---

## 5. User Experience and Polish

- [ ] Improve form validation UX with inline errors and keyboard navigation
- [ ] Ensure full mobile responsiveness and touch-friendly interactions
- [ ] Standardize visual styles and add loading states
- [ ] Implement toast notifications and global error boundaries
- [ ] Provide clear override/veto UI with confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Enhance digest notifications and preview components
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, focus management)

---

## 6. Documentation and Deployment Readiness

- [ ] Complete README with setup, development workflow, and troubleshooting
- [ ] Document docker-compose and deployment scripts
- [ ] Add instructions for environment variables and API keys
- [ ] Maintain TESTING_LOG.md with test results and recommendations
- [ ] Ensure CI/CD workflows run tests and linting
- [ ] Prepare demo data seed scripts for proposals, users, comments, votes

---

## 7. Prioritized Task List

### Priority 1: Core Functionality
- [ ] Complete proposal management frontend and backend
- [ ] Implement veto/undo functionality fully
- [ ] Connect authentication context and token refresh
- [ ] Complete agent-service integration with backend routes
- [ ] Add critical unit and API tests

### Priority 2: Integration & Connectivity
- [ ] Digest system frontend integration and notifications
- [ ] Global error handling and loading states
- [ ] Expand test coverage for edge cases and concurrency

### Priority 3: User Experience & Polish
- [ ] Responsive design fixes and accessibility improvements
- [ ] Visual consistency and UX enhancements
- [ ] Toast notifications and error boundaries

### Priority 4: Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Finalize README and deployment instructions
- [ ] Seed data and demo environment setup
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline enhancements

---

## 8. Definitions and Variables

- [ ] Define and document Veto Window (default 24 hours)
- [ ] Define Automation Levels (Manual, Assisted, Semi-Autonomous, Fully Autonomous)
- [ ] Define Play Money Mode behavior and UI indicators
- [ ] Define Agent Identity and cryptographic key management
- [ ] Define Digest Frequency options and delivery channels

---

## Rituals and Practices

- [ ] Use progressive enhancement: start with minimal viable implementations, then polish
- [ ] Continuous testing: test each feature as completed, update TESTING_LOG.md
- [ ] Parallel development: assign team members to core features, settings, veto functionality
- [ ] Use simulation modes to safely test agent autonomy levels
- [ ] Maintain transparency and auditability in override and veto actions
- [ ] Prioritize user sovereignty and control in all features and UI flows

---

This checklist will serve as the authoritative source for all further prototype work and tracking. It aligns with the rituals and practices encapsulated in the prototype documentation to ensure a high-quality, user-centered, and secure governance system.
