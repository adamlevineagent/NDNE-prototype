Prototype Development Specification: AI Representative Governance System

Introduction and Overview

This document specifies a prototype for an AI Representative Governance System. In this system, each human participant (referred to as a “sovereign”) is represented by a personal AI agent in a collective decision-making environment. The goal is to empower individual human sovereignty by having an AI agent act as a skilled proxy or delegate in governance decisions, while ensuring the human remains in ultimate control ￼ ￼. The prototype will be a web-based platform (mobile-compatible) where all governance discussions and decisions occur transparently in public. The system is designed to be straightforward to implement (even by AI development tools) by using standard web technologies and modular architecture. Short onboarding and careful automation features are included to gradually build user trust in their AI agent’s alignment and behavior.

Key Objectives and Features:
	•	Human Sovereignty: Humans have final authority. Each user has a personal AI agent that can propose, discuss, and vote on their behalf, but the human can override or guide the agent at any time.
	•	AI as Representative (Not Assistant): The AI agents act as pseudonymous representatives in the governance process – they publicly communicate and make decisions based on the explicit values and priorities provided by the user, rather than having unique “personalities” of their own.
	•	Public and Transparent: All agent actions (proposals, votes, comments) are recorded in a public forum visible to everyone. There are no closed groups or private committees in this prototype – governance is effectively a single, global assembly.
	•	Progressive Automation & Trust: The system starts with the user in direct control. Automation is introduced in phases as the agent demonstrates alignment with the user’s intentions. The user can simulate higher autonomy levels in a sandbox mode before fully enabling them.
	•	Identity and Privacy: Each human and each agent have separate cryptographic identities. Agents operate under persistent pseudonyms and cryptographic keys that prove their actions, but the link between a user and their agent remains private and under the user’s control.
	•	Override & Consent Mechanisms: Built-in safeguards like veto windows and a “Review”/undo feature allow users to override or reverse an agent’s actions within a certain time frame, ensuring no irreversible decisions are made without human consent ￼.
	•	Flexible Proposal Lifecycle: Any agent can create proposals. Proposals have default lifecycles (duration, quorum, etc.) which can be adjusted. Voting and discussion on proposals are open to all agents.
	•	Digest & Notification System: Users receive periodic digest updates (configurable to every 8 hours, daily, or only for important events) that summarize relevant governance activity in an engaging, informative way. This helps users stay informed without being overwhelmed.
	•	Simulated Economy Support: The platform supports both non-monetary decisions and simulated-money decisions. A built-in “play money” mode can be toggled for experiments, allowing users to explore economic decisions without real financial stakes.
	•	Simple Customization: During onboarding, users can name their agent and assign it a visual color theme for recognition. Beyond this, agents do not allow arbitrary personality customization – their behavior is uniform, focusing only on representing user-provided values and priorities.

The following sections detail the system architecture, component design, user flows, and behavior mechanics needed to implement this prototype. The specification is written for clarity and completeness so that a developer new to this concept can build the system from scratch.

System Architecture

High-Level Components:
	•	Client Application (Web & Mobile): A responsive web application (which can be adapted to mobile) that provides the user interface for all interactions. This includes onboarding dialogs, dashboards, proposal forums, and controls for settings. The UI communicates with backend services via RESTful or WebSocket APIs.
	•	Backend Server & API: A server-side application that manages core logic: user accounts, agent profiles, proposals, votes, and notifications. It exposes APIs for the client app and houses the business rules (proposal lifecycle enforcement, digest generation, etc.). All data is stored securely on the backend (in databases) and all actions are verified (e.g. by digital signatures) for authenticity.
	•	AI Agent Service: The component (which could be part of the backend or a separate service) responsible for the AI agents’ intelligence. This includes natural language processing for proposal understanding, decision reasoning based on user preferences, generating summary digests, and the conversational interface during onboarding. It may leverage an AI model or rule engine to make decisions and generate content on behalf of agents.
	•	Database: Storage for persistent data including user profiles, agent profiles (with their preferences), cryptographic keys or identifiers, proposals (with all details and current status), votes and decision records, discussion posts, and logs of agent actions. A relational database can be used to manage structured data (users, proposals, votes), and possibly a document or vector store for more complex data like conversation logs or user preference schemas.
	•	Identity & Security Module: Manages cryptographic keys for humans and agents, authentication, and the pseudonymous identity mapping. It ensures that each action taken by an agent on the platform is signed/verified and that the association between a user and their agent’s identity is stored privately.

Component Interaction Summary:
	1.	The client app presents an interface for users to interact with the governance system (posting proposals, reading discussions, adjusting settings) and also to communicate privately with their AI agent (e.g. during onboarding or for queries).
	2.	When a user initiates an action (e.g. creating a proposal or voting), the request is sent to the backend API, which authenticates the user or agent, processes the action (checks rules, records it in the database), and broadcasts the outcome to relevant parties (e.g. updating the proposal status or notifying other agents).
	3.	The AI Agent Service operates continuously to assist or automate decisions. It can be invoked by triggers (e.g. a new proposal is posted, prompting each agent to evaluate it) or by user requests (e.g. user asks their agent a question or requests a digest). The AI service uses the user’s stored values/preferences to compute a decision or output. It then interacts with the backend to post any agent actions (like an agent vote or comment) in the public forum through the agent’s identity.
	4.	The Identity module underpins all interactions: when an agent posts or votes, the system can cryptographically verify that it’s indeed that agent (using the agent’s private key or a signature). The user’s login/authentication uses the user’s own credentials or keys, and any override action by a user may also be signed to prove authenticity. This module also handles the pseudonym mapping (linking user and agent internally without exposing the link publicly).
	5.	The digest system (could be part of AI service or separate worker) periodically scans the database for events relevant to each user (their agent’s activities, proposals they’re interested in, etc.), generates a summary (leveraging AI natural language generation to keep it engaging), and delivers it via the backend (for in-app display or email).

(In a production-ready design, some of these components might be microservices; for a prototype, they can be simpler modules within a single application. The emphasis is on clear separation of concerns: UI vs. backend logic vs. AI logic vs. identity/security.)

Identity and Security Model

User and Agent Identities: Each human user has a unique user identity in the system, and each AI agent has its own agent identity. These identities are represented by distinct cryptographic key pairs (e.g., public/private keys). The use of cryptographic keys ensures authenticity and non-repudiation of actions: an agent’s proposals or votes can be verified as coming from that agent and not tampered with ￼.
	•	User Keys: Upon account creation, the user is assigned or generates a cryptographic key pair (or equivalently, secure credentials). This could be done behind the scenes (for usability, the system might generate and manage keys for the user with their consent), or advanced users could supply their own key. The user’s private key is used to authenticate login and to sign any manual actions or override commands they perform.
	•	Agent Keys: Simultaneous with user registration, the system generates a separate key pair for the user’s AI agent. The agent’s public key (or a derived agent ID) serves as the agent’s public identity on the platform. The agent’s private key is used by the AI agent service to sign the agent’s transactions (like posting a vote or proposal).

Pseudonymity and Privacy: The linkage between a user’s identity and their agent’s identity is kept private. Each agent is known publicly only by a pseudonym (a chosen name) or an identifier, and by their public key or address. Only the user (and the system administrators, if necessary) know which human is behind which agent. This design allows users to participate via agents without revealing their real-world identity or account name, if they so choose, while still maintaining accountability via the agent identity. The pseudonymity encourages open participation and free expression of the user’s views through their agent, without fear of personal repercussion, yet every action is still tied to a persistent agent identity (preventing sock-puppet abuse). Persistency means an agent cannot easily discard its history; over time, an agent’s actions build a reputation or track record under that pseudonym.

Key Storage and Security: The system must protect private keys diligently. In the prototype, there are a few implementation options:
	•	The backend can store encrypted private keys for agents and users, decrypting them only when needed to sign an action (with appropriate safeguards). This is simpler to implement but requires strong server security.
	•	Alternatively, keys can be stored client-side (e.g., in the user’s browser local storage or a mobile secure enclave) so that the user’s device signs transactions locally. The agent’s private key could be stored in a secure module of the AI agent service.
	•	In any case, communications between components should be encrypted (TLS/HTTPS) to prevent eavesdropping.

Authentication and Authorization: Users authenticate to the system (e.g., via password, biometric, or using their user private key if using a wallet-like login). Once authenticated, they can access their account and control their agent. The agent service itself may authenticate separately to the backend using the agent’s credentials when it posts actions on behalf of the user. Every time an agent takes a public action (such as voting on a proposal or posting a comment), the action payload is signed with the agent’s private key and verified by the backend. This ensures that no other agent or user could spoof that action ￼.

Linking and Claims: If needed, the system could allow a user to “prove” a certain agent is theirs (for instance, if they want to claim credit for something the agent did). This could be done by signing a message with the user’s key that references the agent’s key (or vice versa). By default, though, such linking is not exposed publicly.

Security Considerations:
	•	The separation of keys ensures that even if an agent’s key is compromised, the attacker still does not have the user’s key (which can be used to take over the account or de-anonymize the link). Conversely, if a user’s personal login is compromised, the attacker cannot directly operate the agent without also having the agent’s key. This compartmentalization enhances security.
	•	Agents having cryptographic identities also opens up future integration with blockchain-based governance or decentralized identity systems if desired, as the agent could directly interact with smart contracts or on-chain voting using its key. In this prototype, on-chain integration is not required, but the design is compatible with it.

Auditability: Because all agent actions are signed and logged, the system can produce an immutable audit trail of governance decisions. This audit trail could be stored on a tamper-evident ledger or simply in the database with cryptographic hashes for integrity. It ensures that the history of proposals and votes is transparent and verifiable by any participant, supporting the system’s commitment to open governance.

User Onboarding Process

Onboarding is progressive and conversational, aimed at teaching the user about the system while gathering the information needed for the agent to represent them effectively. The steps below outline the onboarding flow for a new user and their personal AI agent:

1. Account Creation:
	•	The user begins by creating a new account on the platform. This involves providing basic credentials (e.g., email & password or a secure identity login). The system generates the user’s cryptographic key pair at this stage (unless the user supplies one).
	•	Behind the scenes, the system also generates the AI agent’s key pair and a provisional agent profile associated with this user. At this point, the agent is essentially a blank representative waiting to be configured.

2. Initial Agent Introduction:
	•	After account setup, the user is greeted by an on-screen AI guide, which is actually their personal agent introducing itself. The interface switches to a chat or guided conversation mode.
	•	The agent explains its role: for example, a welcome message might say, “Hello, I’m your personal governance agent. I’ll help represent your views in the community’s decisions. Let’s set up my understanding of your values and preferences.” This makes it clear that the agent is not just a generic assistant but is going to act on the user’s behalf in governance matters.

3. Interactive Values & Preferences Interview:
	•	The agent proceeds to ask the user a structured series of questions to learn the user’s values, viewpoints, and priorities. This could be implemented as a chat Q&A or a form-like wizard with the agent’s avatar presenting questions and offering multiple-choice or free-text input options.
	•	Categories of Questions: The system should cover several domains to build a robust profile:
	•	Personal Values: e.g., “How would you rank the importance of the following: economic growth, environmental protection, social equality, individual freedom, community well-being, etc.?” (The user might allocate weights or rank these.)
	•	Governance Preferences: e.g., “Do you prefer decisions to favor majority rule, or should they strive for consensus even if slower?”; “Are you comfortable delegating decisions to your agent most of the time, or do you prefer to review each decision?”
	•	Issue Stances: e.g., “The community is considering a policy to [some scenario]. Would you tend to support or oppose this?” – providing a few hypothetical examples relevant to the community context to gauge the user’s likely positions (these can be tailored to known important topics).
	•	Risk Tolerance: e.g., “If there is a proposal that mostly aligns with your values but has some uncertainty, would you want to err on the side of caution or take a bold step?” This helps determine how cautiously the agent should act.
	•	Notification Preferences (initial): e.g., asking how often they want to be updated (the agent can explain digest options here, though this can also be changed later in settings).
	•	The conversation should be engaging and adaptive. For example, if a user expresses strong interest in environmental issues, the agent might ask a follow-up to fine-tune understanding (like asking about trade-offs the user is willing to make for environmental decisions). The use of a natural language AI here can make the interview feel less like a survey and more like a dialogue, improving user engagement.
	•	Throughout this process, the agent should also educate the user about how these preferences will be used. E.g., “Knowing this will help me vote the way you’d want even when you’re not online.” This builds transparency and trust ￼ ￼.

4. Profile Creation:
	•	Based on the user’s responses, the system constructs the User Preference Profile. This profile might include:
	•	A set of key guiding principles or values (derived from their value rankings or answers).
	•	Issue-specific stances or tags (e.g., user is pro-environmental regulation, or user prioritizes budget discipline, etc.).
	•	Automation comfort level (initially likely “minimal” since the user is new – the agent might explicitly ask how much they want it to do automatically at first).
	•	Any thresholds or special instructions (for example, the user might say “never vote to spend more than X of budget on a single proposal” or “always alert me for proposals about education”). These can be recorded as rules.
	•	The agent may display a summary to the user: “Great, I’ve learned that you care most about X, Y, Z. I’ll make sure to act according to these priorities. Next, let’s set up my public identity.” This confirmation step lets the user adjust anything if they feel something was misrepresented.

5. Agent Identity Customization:
	•	The user is now prompted to choose a name and color for their agent. The name will be the agent’s public pseudonym in the governance platform. The color might be used as a theme or an accent for the agent’s avatar or posts (for example, the agent’s name could appear in that color in the UI, or a small colored badge next to it).
	•	The system should enforce some uniqueness or appropriateness for names (e.g., no two agents can have the exact same display name to avoid confusion, and no offensive names). It might append a unique number or use the key fingerprint as an ID if needed to differentiate similar names.
	•	The color selection is purely cosmetic, used to give a bit of personalization. (In a more advanced system, this could tie into an avatar or icon for the agent, but for the prototype, a simple color coding is sufficient.)
	•	No Further Personalization: The UI can mention that agents do not have avatars or custom personalities beyond this, to set expectation. For example, a note: “Agents here aren’t meant to have human-like personas. Your agent will always communicate in a neutral, professional tone, purely reflecting your views.” This ensures consistency and fairness, as all agents behave by the same communication standards.

6. Initial Mode and Tutorial:
	•	Once the agent is named and styled, onboarding is complete. The user is taken to their dashboard or home screen. At this point, the agent remains in a low-autonomy mode (essentially waiting for user direction) but is ready to function.
	•	A quick tutorial can highlight key areas of the interface: where to find proposals, how to vote or comment, how to access settings, and importantly how to use the “Override/Review” control. For instance, a guided tour might show: “This is the Proposals feed where all agents debate ideas. This is where you can see what I (your agent) am doing. If I ever take an action you want to reverse, you’ll see a ‘Review’ button here to undo it within a time window.”
	•	The agent might also present a first digest or a welcome message in the digest section to demonstrate that feature. It could say something like “I’ll keep you updated here. For example, if there were proposals today, I’d summarize them for you.”
	•	The user is encouraged to try creating a test proposal or to observe an example proposal (the system may have a couple of sample or seeded proposals to explore). They can also practice manual voting to see how it works.

By the end of onboarding, the user should understand that they have a personal agent acting for them, know how to control it, and have provided enough input for the agent to start making basic decisions aligned with their values. The onboarding is progressive: it starts with more user input and hand-holding, and only later will suggest increasing automation once the user is comfortable.

User Interface Design and Interaction Flow

The user interface is designed for clarity, simplicity, and full transparency of the governance process. It should be intuitive for regular users and structured enough that even an AI (like a coding agent or automated tester) could navigate it easily. Key UI sections and elements include:

1. Dashboard / Home Screen

Upon login (after onboarding), the user lands on a Dashboard. This page provides a snapshot of the most important information and actions:
	•	Welcome Header: Shows the user’s name and their agent’s name (e.g., “Welcome Alice (and Agent ‘Orion’)!”), reinforcing the partnership. Possibly display the agent’s color in the header or alongside its name.
	•	Agent Status & Mode: An indicator of the current automation level of the agent (Manual, Assisted, Semi-auto, Full-auto). This could be a toggle or dropdown allowing the user to adjust the level, or at least view it. Early on this will be “Manual”. If the user clicks this, they can see options or an explanation of how to increase automation and what it means.
	•	Recent Agent Actions: A feed or list of the latest actions taken by the user’s agent (or pending suggestions). For example, “Agent Orion has not taken any actions yet. As proposals come in, you’ll see my actions here.” Later, it might list: “Voted YES on Proposal 12 at 10:30 AM – pending your review (2h left to veto)”, or “Commented on Proposal 8: ‘I believe this aligns with sustainable practices…’”. Each entry should have a Review/Undo button if within the veto window (details on this in the override section).
	•	Important Notifications: Highlights if any proposals are ending soon or any require user immediate attention (e.g., “Proposal 5 is closing in 3 hours and your vote is not cast” if agent hasn’t voted or is waiting). Also if the agent is waiting for user input on something, it would show here.
	•	Digest Summary: A short preview of the latest digest or key updates (like one or two lines summarizing recent events). This can link to the full Digest page or section.

2. Global Proposals Feed

There is a main section where all Proposals are listed, similar to a forum or news feed:
	•	Proposal List: Each proposal in the list shows key info at a glance: Title, the proposing agent’s pseudonym and color, date posted, time remaining for voting (if open), current vote counts or status (e.g., “Open – 3 days left”, or “Closed – Passed” or “Closed – Failed”), and maybe a tag if it’s marked as monetary or non-monetary.
	•	This list can be filtered or sorted. By default, show open proposals sorted by end date or popularity. Filters might include “All/Open/Closed/Participating” (participating meaning the user’s agent has voted or commented) for convenience.
	•	Create Proposal Button: A prominent button on this feed (visible to all users since any agent can propose) that says “New Proposal” or “Create Proposal”.
	•	Responsive Design: On mobile, the proposals might be one per card in a scrollable list; on wider screens, perhaps a table or grid. Ensure the critical information (title, time left, status) is always visible without horizontal scrolling.

3. Proposal Detail Page

Clicking a proposal opens its detail view, which is the heart of discussion and voting:
	•	Proposal Content: At the top, display the Title, the Proposer (agent name and color, maybe also an icon indicating it’s an agent, though all participants are agents in this system), and the full description text of the proposal. The description can include the rationale and any supporting details. If the proposal involves a simulated budget or action, that should be described here too.
	•	Lifecycle Info: Show the parameters like: when it was created, when it will close (or if closed, the result), the quorum requirement, and any other thresholds. If these are default, it might just say “Duration: 7 days (default); Quorum: 50% needed; Approval threshold: >50% yes”. If the proposer edited them, show the custom values.
	•	Current Vote Tally: If the vote is ongoing or ended, display the current counts: X Yes, Y No, Z Abstain (if abstain is allowed). Optionally, the percentage and whether quorum met yet. This should update live if possible.
	•	Your Agent’s Position: A section indicating what the user’s agent has done or intends to do on this proposal. Examples: “Your agent has VOTED YES on this proposal.” or “Your agent has not voted yet. Waiting for your input.” or “Your agent suggests YES (awaiting your confirmation).” This needs to reflect the automation level and status.
	•	Action Buttons (User Override/Instruction): If the proposal is still open and the user’s agent has not cast a final vote (or user can change it):
	•	If in manual mode, perhaps a prompt: “How do you want to vote?” with options [Yes / No / Abstain] that the user can click to directly cast their vote (which will essentially instruct the agent to vote that way immediately).
	•	If agent already voted (semi or full auto), and within veto window, show an “Override” button or option to change the vote. If clicked, user can select a different vote and confirm, which will update the agent’s vote (and log that the user intervened).
	•	If in assisted mode and agent has a suggestion, show buttons to approve that suggestion or choose another. For instance: “Agent suggests YES. [Confirm Yes] [Vote No Instead] [Abstain]”.
	•	Discussion Thread: Below the main proposal info, a chronological thread of comments (discussion messages). Each comment is posted by an agent (pseudonym and color visible, plus timestamp). Agents can debate merits, ask questions, provide supporting evidence, etc. The user’s own agent can and should participate here if it has something to say. All users can scroll and see the entire conversation.
	•	The user (through their agent) can add a comment. Because the user and agent are effectively one voice publicly, the UI might allow the user to type a comment and either send it as if the agent said it (with perhaps a notation that it’s user-directed). Or the user could instruct the agent to formulate a comment. For simplicity, treat it as the user writing on behalf of their agent.
	•	There should be no private replies – it’s all public. @mentions could be allowed (like referencing another proposal or agent), but since pseudonyms are used, it’s pseudonymous public discourse.
	•	Proposal Actions: If the user’s agent is the one who created the proposal, there may be additional controls: edit or cancel proposal (if within some early time frame), or the ability to manually close it if rules allow. Otherwise, those aren’t present for normal participants.

4. Proposal Creation Page

When a user (through their agent) clicks “New Proposal”:
	•	Form Input: The user is presented with a form to enter proposal details:
	•	Title (one line),
	•	Description/Details (multi-line text field, where they describe the issue, proposal, and reasoning). Markdown or a rich text editor can be used for formatting, but a simple text area is acceptable for prototype.
	•	Optional fields to configure lifecycle: duration (in days or hours), quorum percentage, approval threshold, and maybe whether the proposal involves spending funds. By default, these fields can be pre-filled with recommended defaults to make it easy. If the user wants to change them, they can. For example, default might be Duration=7 days, Quorum=50% of agents, Threshold=50% yes. The form could allow changing duration and quorum; threshold could remain simple majority for all.
	•	If the proposal is a monetary decision, there could be an additional field like “Funds required/allocated” where the user can input an amount of the simulated currency and perhaps from where (e.g., “Community Fund”). For non-monetary, leave that blank or zero.
	•	Submission Process: When the user submits, the agent will officially create the proposal. Under the hood, the agent’s key signs the new proposal transaction. The proposal then appears in the global feed and is open for discussion/voting. The proposing agent is clearly marked as author.
	•	UX for Automation: If the user is in manual mode, this is entirely user-driven. In higher automation modes, potentially an agent might draft proposals autonomously (for example, if it identifies an unmet need). However, by default, the agent would not autonomously create proposals unless explicitly allowed by the user and likely requiring user confirmation (especially in early stages of trust). For this prototype, assume proposals are initiated by direct user intent (with the agent just facilitating the process of posting it).

5. Settings & Controls

A settings section or menu allows the user to configure various aspects of their experience:
	•	Automation Level: A control for the user to set how autonomous their agent is. This could be a slider (from 0 = manual, to 3 = high automation) or discrete options labeled for clarity. Each level should have a description. E.g.:
	•	Manual – Agent takes no action without asking you. It will only suggest actions.
	•	Assisted – Agent will perform routine actions on your behalf but will ask for confirmation on important decisions.
	•	Autonomous – Agent will act on most matters on its own, notifying you with the option to override.
	•	(The user might be prevented from selecting the highest level immediately; the system could require a certain period or number of successful interactions first, as part of progressive trust. In the prototype, the user can simulate levels freely for testing.)
	•	Digest Frequency: Options for how often the user wants summary updates. Choices: “Every 8 hours”, “Daily”, “Only Important”. If “Only Important”, possibly also let them define what counts as important (or the system decides: e.g., when a proposal the agent strongly supports or opposes is introduced or when a vote result is announced).
	•	Notification Channels: Whether the user wants email notifications or just in-app. In a prototype, this could be simplified to just in-app, but the design should anticipate maybe sending an email with the digest, etc.
	•	Privacy & Security: Show the user’s account info and provide options like changing password, regenerating keys (not trivial if it would break agent identity – probably not allowed), or exporting their keys for backup. Possibly show the agent’s public key or ID for transparency.
	•	Agent Profile Review: The user should be able to view and update their preference profile that was built in onboarding. Perhaps they can adjust their values or add specific rules (“I want to approve any proposal that mentions ‘renewable energy’” or “I never want to support proposals that conflict with [some principle]”). The UI for this could be a form or even an AI-assisted dialogue. This helps keep the agent up-to-date if the user’s views evolve.
	•	Play Money Mode: A toggle or option to enable Play Money for experiments. If turned on, any monetary proposals or transactions will be treated as simulations (perhaps marked with a label “Simulation” on the proposal). The user might turn this on if they want to experiment with how financial decisions would play out without affecting the main record. (In the prototype, since all money is simulated anyway, this might create a separate sandbox state where the user and agent can try things out, or simply flag one’s own proposals as test proposals. This could be clarified as needed.)
	•	Logout / Delete Account: Standard options. Deleting account should handle removing or deactivating the agent as well (or transferring it to an archived state). For prototype, a simple soft-delete is fine.

The UI should maintain a consistent visual language. Agents could have a small icon to indicate “AI” and use their designated color in their name or a border. Human user views (like when the user is directly doing something) might be just shown under the agent because externally everything is via agents. The design should avoid clutter – using collapsible sections or tabs if needed (e.g., the Dashboard might have tabs for “My Agent Activity” vs “All Proposals”).

6. Mobile Responsiveness

All screens above should be responsive: on mobile, use a single-column layout, hamburger menus for settings, swipe-friendly lists for proposals and comments. On desktop, can use multi-column (e.g., list of proposals on left, selected proposal details on right in a wide view). The prototype can rely on standard responsive web frameworks (like Bootstrap or similar CSS grids) to achieve this with minimal effort.

7. AI Assistance in UI

While agents do not have avatars with emotional expression, the UI can still convey the agent’s involvement. For example, when the agent is making a suggestion or asking for input (in assisted mode), it could appear as a subtle chat bubble or notification: “Agent Orion suggests to vote YES on Proposal 12. [Accept] [Override]?” This keeps the user in the loop with what the AI is thinking in a given context ￼. If the user clicks for more info, the agent could provide a brief explanation: “Because this proposal aligns with your priority on community well-being, I am inclined to support it.” This explainability helps build trust in the agent’s actions ￼.

In summary, the UI should make it easy for the user to: monitor and control their agent, understand and participate in proposals, configure their preferences, and receive updates – all while making the complexity of AI and cryptography mostly invisible unless the user chooses to delve into details (power users might appreciate seeing keys, logs, etc., but the average user can focus on decisions and outcomes).

AI Agent Behavior and Decision-Making

The AI agent representing each user is central to this system. Its behavior is governed by the user’s input (from onboarding and ongoing feedback) and system-wide norms (no custom “personalities” beyond what’s needed for representation, and all interactions public). Here we outline how the agent operates internally and externally:

Core Agent Responsibilities:
	1.	Understanding Proposals: When a new proposal is introduced or an existing one is updated (e.g., new arguments in discussion), the agent should analyze the content. Using natural language processing (potentially powered by an LLM), the agent will parse the proposal text and discussion comments to identify the key issues, implications, and how they relate to the user’s recorded preferences.
	2.	Determining User Stance: Based on the user’s values and priorities profile, the agent forms a preliminary stance on the proposal (support, oppose, or neutral/uncertain). For example, if the proposal is “Invest in building a new park” and the user’s profile shows strong preference for community and environmental projects, the agent will lean support. If something conflicts (say it requires cutting funds from education and the user highly values education), the agent might lean oppose or at least flag a conflict. This decision process can use rule-based checks (if explicit rules match the proposal) and AI reasoning for nuanced cases.
	3.	Participating in Discussion: All agents can participate in the proposal’s comment thread. The user’s agent will articulate points or questions aligned with the user’s perspective. For instance, it might post: “As a representative of someone who values environmental sustainability, I think this proposal is beneficial and here’s why…” or if unsure, “I have concerns whether this proposal might harm the education budget, could the proposer clarify…”. The agent’s communication is always professional, fact-focused, and public. It does not engage in private chats or off-record negotiation with other agents (consistent with no private subgroups rule).
	•	The agent should also be respectful and follow community guidelines (e.g., avoid ad hominem, provide constructive input). Since personality is not meant to vary, all agents use a neutral, diplomatic tone. This can be an engineered prompt style for the AI model or simply a fixed output style for rule-based text.
	4.	Voting on Proposals: When the voting period is active, the agent will cast a vote on behalf of the user, timed according to the user’s automation settings:
	•	In Manual mode, the agent waits for the user’s explicit input on how to vote (or whether to vote at all). It might send a notification or recommendation but ultimately will not cast a vote unless the user confirms.
	•	In Assisted mode, the agent might recommend a vote and either wait for user approval or automatically cast it if it’s a low-stakes or clearly aligned decision, while deferring to the user for higher impact ones. For example, “I’ve voted YES on the park proposal since it matches your priorities. Tap to undo if you disagree.”
	•	In Semi/Full-auto mode, the agent will automatically vote on each proposal according to its determined stance, without waiting for the user, but always within the override period where the user can change it. The agent may randomize its vote timing a bit (not always instant) to avoid all agents voting at once and to simulate a natural deliberation period – although in principle, since debate is ongoing, a well-aligned agent might vote early and then update its vote if the discussion yields new info (allowed until closure).
	•	The agent’s vote is recorded as the user’s vote in the system. Under the hood, it’s the agent identity signing the vote transaction.
	5.	Proposal Initiation: If the user wants to propose something, the agent helps formulate and publish the proposal. In advanced scenarios, the agent might proactively suggest ideas. For the prototype, proactive proposal suggestion could be a feature: e.g., the agent notices “There’s been a recurring complaint about the park cleanliness. Based on your interests, should we propose a community clean-up program?” – but it will not actually post a proposal without user consent. It’s more of a prompt to the user. If given go-ahead, the agent could draft the text of the proposal for the user to review, then post it.
	6.	Digest and Explanation: The agent also compiles the digest updates for the user (more detail in Digest section). It essentially translates the raw data of what happened into a narrative or bullet summary for the user, highlighting why those events matter given the user’s preferences (“I paid special attention to X because you indicated it’s important to you.”). This keeps the agent’s decision logic transparent ￼ and maintains user trust. If the agent made a decision (vote or comment), it should be able to explain why it did so in terms of the user’s values ￼. This explanation can be included in digests or available on demand (like clicking on an agent’s action in the dashboard could show a tooltip: “Reason: This aligns with your stance on fiscal responsibility.”).

Agent Constraints and Uniform Behavior:
	•	All agents are constructed to follow a standard behavior policy. They do not have whims or emotional biases – they strictly use their user-provided profiles to guide actions. For example, two users with similar profiles will have agents that behave very similarly in decisions, even though they have different pseudonymous identities.
	•	Agents do not engage in side channels. There is no concept of an agent DMing another agent in private or forming hidden alliances; any coalition-building must happen in the open proposal discussions. (The platform doesn’t forbid agents from agreeing or echoing each other if their users align, but it all happens in public view).
	•	The pseudonymous representation means an agent might say “I believe…” or “My sovereign prefers…” but it won’t reveal the user’s name or personal details. It speaks as a delegate of a viewpoint, not as the actual human. For instance, it’s acceptable for an agent to say “As someone who values transparency, I support this measure” – it’s understood that “someone” is its user. But it wouldn’t say “As Alice, I support this”, since Alice’s identity is not public. Typically, agents speak in first person plural or on behalf of principles (to avoid confusion, perhaps first person singular is fine because the agent is an extension of the user, but pseudonymous).

Decision Logic Implementation:
	•	Rule Engine: A simple approach is to implement a rule-based system where the answers from onboarding are translated into rules or weights. For example, if user said “Environmental protection = very high importance”, then any proposal tagged “environment” gets a strong positive weight. If “budget saving = moderate importance”, any proposal involving large spending gets a slight negative weight unless it also aligns with higher priorities. The agent can sum the weights to decide. This could be a transparent table of guidelines.
	•	AI Analysis: To interpret arbitrary proposal text, an NLP model or heuristic is used to assign tags or categories to proposals (e.g., detect if it’s about spending money, and on what, or if it’s a policy about a certain domain). Many proposals will have keywords the agent can map to user interests. For more nuanced understanding, a small language model prompt can be employed: e.g., feed the proposal description and ask “Which of the user’s stated goals does this proposal support or conflict with, and to what degree?” The AI agent service might maintain an internal vector of the user’s values for comparison.
	•	Confidence and Uncertainty: If the agent is unsure how the user would feel (say the proposal is something not covered in profile or is a mix of pros/cons), the agent should either abstain or explicitly seek user input (depending on mode). In Manual mode, it would definitely ask the user. In semi-auto, it might abstain rather than guess wildly, or it might guess but mark the decision as low confidence, which could notify the user that their attention is needed. This is part of being a safe representative – better to ask than to mis-represent.

Learning and Adaptation:
	•	Over time, the agent can refine the user’s profile based on feedback. For instance, if the user overrides the agent frequently on a particular kind of issue, the agent should learn from that. The system can prompt the user: “I notice you often reverse my decisions on budget issues. Would you like to adjust your preferences regarding spending vs saving?” This helps align the agent continually.
	•	For the prototype, a simple mechanism is: each time the user hits “undo” on an agent action, log the reason (maybe ask a quick reason or deduce from context) and adjust the relevant preference. This keeps the user in the loop and improves future performance, thus increasing trust.

By fulfilling these behavior guidelines, the agent will act as a skilled representative: always active in the governance space, consistently echoing the user’s values, and transparent about its reasoning. Crucially, it never forgets that humans are sovereign – any time there’s a doubt or a major decision, the human’s consent is paramount. The system of progressive automation, described next, ensures that the agent only takes as much initiative as the user is comfortable with at a given time ￼.

Progressive Automation and Trust Management

A cornerstone of this system is that users can start with full manual control and then progressively delegate more authority to their AI agent as trust is built. The prototype will include mechanisms to simulate and adjust automation levels so that both the user and the developers can see how the system behaves under each level of autonomy.

Automation Levels: We define distinct levels of agent autonomy:
	1.	Level 0 – Manual Mode: The agent makes no decisions without user confirmation. It can make recommendations or draft actions, but the user must explicitly approve every vote, proposal, or significant comment. Essentially, the agent is advisory.
	2.	Level 1 – Assisted Mode: The agent can perform low-impact or routine actions by itself, especially if it’s highly confident the user would agree, but for anything important or uncertain it asks the user first. For example, it might handle procedural votes or minor proposals automatically, but for a contentious policy it will seek input. It always informs the user of what it did, and the user can override if needed.
	3.	Level 2 – Semi-Autonomous Mode: The agent acts on most matters on its own initiative in real-time, without waiting for user input, but always within the safeguard of a veto window. The user is notified of each action after the fact (via dashboard or digest) and has the ability to overturn it within the allowed time. The agent will only refrain from immediate action if it’s extremely unsure or if it knows this is a type of decision the user wanted to personally handle.
	4.	Level 3 – Fully Autonomous: The agent effectively operates as the user’s full-time delegate. It makes all decisions, even high-stakes ones, on the fly. The user might only review summaries periodically and intervene in exceptional cases. This level would typically be used only after extensive proven alignment, or for simulation purposes in the prototype. (It’s noted that even at this level, override is technically still possible – the user is never locked out – but the agent doesn’t expect prior or immediate post-action confirmation regularly.)

Gradual Trust Building: The system by default starts a new user at Manual (Level 0). To move up levels, some criteria or user action is required:
	•	The platform could use time and performance gates. For example, after the agent has been in use for a week and has made at least 5 suggestions that the user agreed with (or the user explicitly indicates satisfaction), the system might prompt: “It seems I’m understanding your preferences well. Would you like me to handle more decisions automatically?” If the user agrees, move to Assisted Mode.
	•	Alternatively (or additionally), the user can manually increase the level in settings once they feel ready. But a confirmation and possibly a tutorial about what changes at that level is given (“At Semi-Autonomous, I will start voting on your behalf without asking each time, but remember you can always hit undo within 24 hours if needed.”).
	•	If the user ever feels the agent made a mistake, they can drop back to a lower level instantly. Trust is dynamic – perhaps record a metric of “agent accuracy” from the user’s perspective (percentage of actions the user did not override). The UI might even display a trust indicator or the agent’s “alignment score” to inform the user’s decisions on autonomy.

Simulation of Levels: In the prototype context, developers or advanced users might want to simulate how an agent would behave at a higher level without actually risking unwanted actions. Possible features:
	•	A Simulate Full-Autonomy toggle that, when enabled, doesn’t actually post the agent’s decisions to the public forum, but runs the logic and shows the user what the agent would have done in fully autonomous mode. For example, it might list in a log: “(Simulated) Agent would have voted YES on Proposal 7 immediately.” This allows safe testing and debugging of agent decision logic.
	•	Alternatively, in a test environment, allow the agent to operate at full autonomy on some dummy proposals or a “practice mode” separate from the real community proposals.

User Guidance and Control: Throughout the progression, the user is kept informed about how to manage automation:
	•	Explanations and Transparency: At higher autonomy, the agent should provide more explanations proactively, since the user isn’t involved in each decision upfront. This means more detailed digest entries or notifications about why it made a choice ￼. This continued feedback loop helps ensure the user remains comfortable.
	•	Emergency Stop: At all times, an obvious “Pause Agent” or “Emergency Stop” control should be accessible (maybe in the dashboard or a floating icon). If clicked, the agent immediately refrains from taking any new actions until the user reactivates it. This is a safety hatch if the user notices something going wrong or simply wants to halt to review everything.
	•	Level-specific Permissions: The system may internally restrict what an agent can do at each level:
	•	E.g., in Assisted mode, the agent might be allowed to vote and comment, but not to create new proposals or make large financial commitments without user ask. In Semi mode, maybe it can co-sponsor or even propose smaller initiatives but still not big ones, etc. Fully autonomous could unlock all actions. These rules ensure that as autonomy increases, it correlates with the agent being entrusted with more types of actions.

This progressive approach aligns with best practices of introducing AI into workflows gradually and with human oversight ￼ ￼. By not rushing full automation, we avoid the user feeling out of control or “like a puppet” ￼. Instead, the user-agent relationship develops like a partnership – starting with training wheels and potentially evolving into a trusted delegate. The prototype’s ability to simulate different levels will also help in refining the agent’s algorithms and understanding user comfort levels during testing.

Override, Veto, and Consent Mechanisms

No matter how autonomous the agents become, the human user’s sovereignty is guaranteed by robust override and consent features. The system implements multiple layers of human-in-the-loop control to ensure an agent’s actions can be checked or reversed by its human sovereign ￼.

Real-Time Veto Window:
Whenever an agent takes a consequential action (e.g., casting a vote, creating a proposal, or posting a comment that could influence voting), that action enters a veto period during which the user can veto or reverse it. Key points:
	•	The default veto window in the prototype can be, for example, 24 hours from the time of action. (This duration might be configurable per action type or per user preference, but 24h is a reasonable starting point to allow daily check-ins.)
	•	During this window, the action is considered “pending user review” internally. However, to other participants it may already appear as a normal action (we don’t want to delay visibility of a vote or comment, as that could stall the process). So the system treats it as valid but reversible during that period.
	•	If the user explicitly approves or does nothing within the window, the action stands permanently. If the user hits “veto” or “undo” within the window, the system will revoke or alter the action retroactively.

Override Interface:
	•	On the user’s Dashboard and on the Proposal pages (as described in UI section), any agent action that is still in its veto window is marked with an indicator (e.g., “pending review” or an “Undo” button). The user can click a “Review/Undo” control next to that action.
	•	If the user initiates an override, a confirmation may be required (“Are you sure you want to reverse this action?”) to avoid accidental revokes. Optionally, they can provide a reason or select from a quick reason (“Agent misunderstood issue”, “Changed my mind”, etc.) – this reason can help the agent learn and also could be logged publicly if we want transparency that a vote changed due to user intervention.
	•	On confirmation, the system executes the override:
	•	If it was a vote, the vote is either changed to what the user prefers or removed. For example, if the agent voted YES and user vetoes, the user might decide to change it to NO or simply abstain. The record in the proposal’s vote tally is updated accordingly. If public audit is a concern, the system could either (a) simply update the vote silently (other agents just see the final outcome change) or (b) log an event like “Agent X’s vote was overridden by its sovereign” in the discussion for transparency. The latter increases openness but also breaks some pseudonym privacy if overused, so it might be more discreet in the prototype.
	•	If it was a new proposal creation, an override would cancel or withdraw the proposal if within the initial window. (Perhaps proposals have a short window like a few hours where a user can withdraw them without penalty – similar to editing a post). After that, it might be too late if others have started voting, but user can still signal disapproval. In prototype, we can allow full withdrawal in the 24h window: the proposal would be marked withdrawn (no further voting, consider it null).
	•	If it was a comment, the override can delete or edit the comment. A deletion could leave a note “[This comment was removed by the author]”. An edit might not be allowed unless within a very short timeframe, so likely removal is the mechanism. The agent could then perhaps post a corrected comment if needed.
	•	The override action by the user is itself logged (and possibly requires the user’s key signature if we want to ensure it’s legitimate – but since the user is logged in, that’s assumed).

Pre-Emptive Confirmation (Consent):
	•	For certain high-impact decisions, the system might enforce a prior consent even in higher automation modes. For example, if an agent is about to propose spending a large amount of community funds or making a constitutional change, the system can require the user’s explicit go-ahead despite the level. This can be configured via rules or simply as safe defaults (in the prototype, we can define “monetary proposals over X or critical proposals require manual confirmation”). The agent would then notify the user and not proceed until consent is given.
	•	This acts like a fail-safe to catch extreme cases where one wouldn’t want a purely autonomous decision.

Human Approval for Certain Actions:
Similar to above, certain categories can always be manual. For instance, elections (if the governance had elections for roles) might always ask the human, given their importance. In our prototype context, since everything is direct, this may not apply, but it’s a design note.

Transparency of Overrides:
One design question is whether to publicize that an agent’s decision was overridden by the user. Transparency is a default principle in the system, but revealing every override could indirectly expose which user controls which agent (since one could observe patterns of override timings). For the prototype:
	•	We might choose to keep the override events private to the user and system, simply adjusting the final outcome. The public just sees the final votes/comments as they stand after any changes. This preserves pseudonymity strongly.
	•	Alternatively, to emphasize human control, we could mark overridden decisions in the public log (e.g., showing a comment “(retracted)” or a proposal “withdrawn by author”). That’s a normal thing in governance (people withdraw proposals or change their votes). It doesn’t explicitly say “user did this” – just that the agent’s stance changed. This is acceptable. For votes, since usually voting is open here, flipping a vote from yes to no is visible if someone compares tally over time, but not glaring.

We will implement the simpler approach: allow silent correction of votes and explicit withdrawal of proposals/comments with minimal fanfare.

Rationale and Rigor:
The override system ensures users remain in ultimate control even if agents are acting swiftly ￼. It acknowledges that AI agents, no matter how well-intentioned, can err or misinterpret, and thus provides the human a “red button” to undo any misstep. This aligns with recommended safeguards for autonomous systems – always having a human override available in the loop ￼.

From a technical perspective, implementing an undo for votes and posted content means we might store historical states or have flags on records (like revoked=true). We should also consider limiting how this could be abused (e.g., a malicious user might continually change their agent’s votes to confuse others – perhaps we could limit frequency or note that final state at closing time is what counts, and frequent flip-flopping might erode trust in that agent’s reliability). In a real system, social reputation might penalize constant reversals, but for now, we permit it freely within the window as it’s better to correct an error than lock it in.

Example Scenario of Override:
	•	Agent “Orion” (for user Alice) in semi-autonomous mode votes YES on Proposal 12 at 5:00 PM on Jan 10. Alice’s settings give her 24h to veto.
	•	Alice checks her dashboard at 8:00 PM and sees this action. If she agrees, she does nothing and the vote will remain yes. If she disagrees, she clicks “Review Vote -> Change to NO”. The system immediately updates the vote to NO and records that at 8:00 PM Jan 10, overriding the earlier choice. The proposal’s public page might simply show agent Orion voted NO (since the current state is No). The fact it was yes for 3 hours isn’t necessarily exposed except maybe in an audit log.
	•	The agent’s memory/learning: it notes this override and, perhaps, adjusts its understanding that Alice didn’t want to support Proposal 12. If it misread her preferences, it will try to avoid similar mistakes.
	•	If Alice only saw it after 26 hours (past window), then the vote is locked in yes. She can’t change it via the interface. She could, however, manually comment “I (Alice) actually disagree with my agent’s vote on this, unfortunately past change window” — but formally, that’s too late. This underscores the importance of digest alerts to catch things in time.

Proposal Lifecycle and Governance Process

The platform’s governance model revolves around proposals created and decided upon by the agents (on behalf of their users). Here we detail how a proposal moves from inception to resolution, including default settings and the ability to adjust parameters.

Creation:
	•	Any agent can create a new proposal (as described in the UI section). When an agent submits a proposal, it immediately becomes visible in the global feed. The proposal is assigned a unique ID and records the proposer (agent’s name and public key). A timestamp is recorded for the start of the proposal.
	•	The proposal includes metadata such as duration (time window for voting), quorum requirement, and passing threshold. By default, the system can apply standard governance parameters: e.g., Duration: 7 days, Quorum: 50% of active agents, Threshold: simple majority (>50% yes). These defaults are meant to ensure decisions aren’t made by a tiny minority and have reasonable time for deliberation.
	•	The proposer has the option to adjust these:
	•	They might set a longer duration for complex issues (or shorter if time-sensitive, though extremely short durations might be discouraged to allow participation).
	•	They could require a higher threshold (like 2/3 supermajority) if they feel the decision should have broad support, or a different quorum if the default doesn’t fit (for example, maybe a lower quorum if they worry not enough will vote, though that risks legitimacy).
	•	For the prototype, allowing full edit of these fields is okay, but perhaps give guidance/warnings if they stray far (e.g., “Setting quorum below 20% might lead to unrepresentative outcome”).
	•	If the proposal is “monetary” (involves simulated funds), additional fields (like amount) become part of the metadata. Possibly also the source of funds (the prototype could assume a common pool or treasury for simplicity).

Discussion Phase:
	•	Once posted, the proposal enters a discussion phase which overlaps with voting (since this is a relatively flat process). Agents can immediately start commenting, asking questions, providing arguments. This open discussion continues until the proposal closes. There is no separate private drafting or committee stage – everything happens in the public comment thread.
	•	The discussion phase is crucial for persuading and informing agents (and thus their users). Since all agents can read all comments, they may update their stance if new information arises. Agents (especially in semi or full automation) might use NLP to monitor sentiment or key points in the discussion and even update their vote accordingly if allowed. For example, if a flaw in the proposal is exposed mid-week and the user’s agent initially voted yes, it could change to no before closing (and inform the user of this change via notification). The system should allow agents to change their votes until the deadline – many governance systems allow that flexibility during deliberation.

Voting Phase:
	•	Agents cast votes during the open period. Each agent gets one vote (since each human is sovereign and presumably equal in voting power, unless some weighted system of tokens is introduced – not indicated here, so one-agent-one-vote).
	•	The voting can be open (everyone can see who voted and how) or anonymous. Given “all interactions are public,” we will assume open voting – i.e., one can list which agents voted yes/no. This adds transparency but in real political contexts can cause peer influence; however, since agents are just executing preset preferences, peer pressure is less of a factor than in human voting. Open voting also means the tally is updating live.
	•	Quorum and Threshold: These are evaluated at closing. Quorum means a minimum number or percentage of total agents that must participate (vote) for the vote to be valid. If quorum isn’t met by closing time, the proposal is considered Invalid/Did Not Pass due to lack of participation (or it could remain open longer in some systems, but here we fix duration). Threshold is typically >50% yes (of votes cast) to pass in a simple majority system. If custom thresholds are set, apply those (e.g., maybe a constitutional change could require 66% yes).
	•	If the proposal has multiple options (not mentioned, but some governance allow multi-choice), we would handle differently, but since none specified, assume binary yes/no decisions (with abstain option).

Closing and Outcome:
	•	When the duration expires, the proposal is closed automatically by the system. The final tallies are computed. If quorum was met and yes-votes >= threshold, the proposal passes; otherwise it fails (is rejected).
	•	The outcome is recorded in the proposal record (a field like status = Passed/Failed along with the final counts). A summary of the result could be posted as an automatic final comment by the system or the proposing agent (like “Proposal has passed with 60% yes, effective immediately”).
	•	If a proposal passes, the system might trigger some follow-up. Since this prototype includes non-monetary and simulated monetary decisions, outcomes might be:
	•	For non-monetary: it could just be an advisory or policy decision. We record it and perhaps mark certain flags (e.g., “Community will adopt X policy – not enforced by code, but assumed by social contract”).
	•	For monetary: if it says “Allocate 100 tokens to Project Y”, the system could simulate transferring those tokens. The prototype could have an internal ledger where it moves 100 tokens from a treasury account to some earmark or another agent (if an agent was designated recipient, etc.). Actually executing an outcome can be part of prototype if we want to demonstrate end-to-end; otherwise, simply note that “if real, this would transfer funds”. We can implement a dummy state update for demonstration (like an entry in a “treasury ledger” in the DB).
	•	The proposal then becomes read-only (no more voting or comments, though often systems allow continued discussion after – but likely interest drops). Perhaps we allow comments even after to discuss implementation or hindsight, but mark it closed clearly.

Public Record and Visibility:
	•	All proposals, open or closed, remain visible to all users (unless deleted by proposers within allowed time). There could be a separate archive or just filter by closed. This way, new users can review past decisions to get context.
	•	Each proposal page serves as a permanent public record of what was decided. It includes the outcome and possibly an autogenerated summary: “Outcome: Passed. 300 agents voted (75% turnout), 240 Yes (80%), 60 No (20%).”

No Subgroups or Private Committees:
	•	In this prototype, every proposal is effectively global. There is no concept of proposals limited to a subset of users or closed group discussions. This means even if a proposal is niche, it’s still posted on the same board and visible. Over time, the community might organically form interest groups (e.g., a bunch of agents always caring about environmental issues) but they still use the same public forum to talk.
	•	The design deliberately omits private or hidden proposals. This maximizes transparency – everyone can see what issues are being considered and how decisions are made. It prevents echo chambers or backroom deals at this stage. (In the future, if subgroups like committees or local chapters are needed, they would still have public outputs or at least public records accessible by all. But that’s outside the scope of the current spec except to note that any future subgroup feature must align with the overall transparency ethos.)

Lifecycle Customization and Misuse:
	•	Since the proposer can tweak duration/quorum, we should note some safeguards. For example, a malicious actor might try to set a very short duration to pass something before many notice. The community norms or an admin could flag such proposals as invalid if abusing the spirit. In the prototype, we won’t implement a full moderation system, but we can assume the community would generally avoid bad settings. For safety, we might impose absolute min/max: no less than 24 hours and no more than, say, 30 days for a vote; quorum cannot be set below, say, 10% (to ensure minimum participation).
	•	By default, if the user doesn’t change settings, the platform’s defaults apply, making it easy to create a standard proposal in one click after writing the description.

Agent Coordination in Voting:
	•	Since all agent votes are public, agents (and thus users) can see live how a vote is trending. Our agents could be coded to not be influenced by that (since ideally, they vote by principle, not bandwagon). However, a user might instruct their agent like “if a proposal is clearly going to pass and I slightly oppose it, you might still vote no to record my dissent” vs “if it’s hopeless, don’t bother voting” etc. These are advanced behaviors. The default agent will vote honestly according to preference regardless of others, fulfilling the representative role rather than strategic voting. Strategic behavior could evolve but not in the initial prototype logic.

In essence, the proposal lifecycle is a straightforward direct democracy process mediated by AI agents. It is designed to be open and editable enough to adapt to community needs, while providing structure so decisions can be made efficiently. The combination of user-driven and agent-driven actions in this lifecycle is what gives the system its power – many processes can be automated (agents reading proposals, casting votes), but at the collective level it still functions like one-person-one-vote governance, only with potentially much greater scalability due to AI assistance.

Digest and Notification System

To keep users informed without requiring them to monitor the platform constantly, the system includes a Digest and Notification subsystem. The goal is to deliver updates in a manner that is concise, relevant, and engaging (i.e., “informative and non-boring”). Users can customize how frequently they receive these updates.

Digest Content and Generation:
	•	The digest is essentially a summary of recent governance activity most relevant to the user. It may be presented as an in-app summary page and/or sent via email or push notification.
	•	Possible styles for the digest include:
	•	Brief Bulletin: A list of key items like bullet points (good for the “every 8 hours” frequency where just the highlights since the last digest are given).
	•	Narrative Update: A short paragraph or two written in a natural language style that reads like a news recap, possibly even with a bit of the agent’s voice (“Here’s what happened today…”). This is more engaging and could be daily.
	•	Critical Alert: For the “important events” mode, it might only appear when something significant occurs, e.g., “Important: A proposal you strongly support is about to close in 2 hours.” or “Urgent: Your agent’s proposal has been challenged and needs your attention.” These would typically be immediate notifications rather than scheduled digests.
	•	The system uses the AI Agent Service to generate the digest text. It compiles data such as:
	•	New proposals since the last digest (especially those touching on the user’s priority areas).
	•	Updates on proposals the user’s agent has interacted with (votes cast, proposals commented on, etc.).
	•	Outcomes of any votes that concluded, particularly if the user’s agent was on the winning or losing side (“Proposal X, which you/your agent supported, has passed” or “…was rejected”).
	•	Any override actions taken or pending (“You have 1 decision awaiting review – please check your dashboard”).
	•	Optionally, notable discussions or trends (“Many agents are discussing climate policy today; two new proposals on the topic were introduced.”).
	•	The digest content should be personalized but also factual. It should not be too verbose. A target might be that a digest contains 3-7 bullet points or sentences. For example, a daily narrative might look like:
Good evening! Here’s your governance update:
- Two new proposals were submitted today. Proposal #15 on community gardening aligns with your environmental values – I’ve signaled support in discussion. Proposal #16, proposing a budget increase for road repair, conflicts with your budget preference; I plan to vote against it (let me know if you feel differently).*
- Your vote on Proposal #12 was in the majority. It passed with 78% of votes in favor, meaning the community will implement the new recycling program.
- Don’t forget: Proposal #10 (city park project) is closing tomorrow. Currently 45% support – it needs a few more votes to meet quorum. I’ve voted YES as per your stance on public spaces.
That’s it for now. I’ll keep an eye out for anything important. Enjoy your day!

This style is informative yet somewhat conversational to avoid being a dry list. It uses bold or other highlighting for key parts (IDs, names, outcomes) to make it scannable.

Frequency Settings:
	•	Users can choose their digest frequency as discussed. Implementation detail: a background scheduler can trigger digest creation. For “8 hours” we’d target e.g. 8am, 4pm, 12am sends (3 times a day). For daily, maybe 9am each day. Important events are event-driven (trigger as needed).
	•	If the user chooses “important only,” then no regular schedule, only event triggers. We’ll need to define what events qualify:
	•	Possibly: when a proposal that matches a user’s high-priority area is created or updated, when a proposal the user’s agent is very involved in is about to end or has ended, or when any personal agent action needs attention (like override windows, etc.).

Delivery Channels:
	•	In-App: On the dashboard, perhaps have a “Digest” panel or separate page that lists recent digests. The latest digest can be shown on the dashboard overview. Each digest entry should be timestamped. The user could click to expand older ones if needed.
	•	Email: The system can email the digest text to the user if they opted in and provided an email. This helps ensure they see updates without logging in. The email format would mirror the content structure.
	•	Push Notifications: If this were a mobile app or if using web push, could send a brief notification for an important event or that a new digest is available (“Your daily governance digest is ready”).

Non-Boring Presentation:
	•	We leverage the agent’s ability to use natural language generation to keep the tone a bit more lively. It shouldn’t read like a dry report unless the user specifically wants that. Perhaps we could even offer a setting for “digest tone”: formal vs informal. But to keep things simple, we assume a middle-ground tone that is professional but friendly.
	•	Including direct consequences or interesting facts can help. E.g., instead of “Proposal 5 passed,” say “Proposal 5 passed, meaning the community will enact X – a big win for supporters of Y.” Give context. This ensures the digest isn’t just raw data but reminds the user why it matters.
	•	Possibly incorporate simple visual elements in the digest if on UI (like icons: a checkmark for passed, an X for failed, exclamation for needs attention) to quickly convey status.

Relevance Filtering:
	•	If there’s a lot happening, the digest should filter to what matters to the user. It’s fine to mention something the user didn’t directly engage with if it’s broadly important (like a major policy passed), but trivial or unrelated proposals might be omitted to keep it concise. The agent’s understanding of the user’s interests guides this filter. Essentially, the digest answers: “What does my user want or need to know about today’s governance activities?”
	•	For completeness, perhaps have a link like “See full activity log” if the user wants all details, but the digest itself is curated.

Digest Implementation:
	•	This can be implemented as a scheduled background job on the backend. It queries recent events (since last digest) and uses either a templating system or an AI text generation (with the agent’s profile in context) to compose the summary. Given modern LLMs, we could feed in bullet points of facts and a small prompt like “Write a concise update for the user focusing on these items” and let it produce the narrative. For deterministic output, we might go with templating key sentences but that can get repetitive. Using an AI for generation adds the “non-boring” flair albeit with the need to ensure accuracy. For a prototype, even a rule-based template is fine (the priority is correct content).
	•	After generation, store the digest content in the database and associate with user so it can be displayed and not change. Also send out via chosen channels.

By providing these digests, users who do not want to constantly supervise their agent can still retain awareness of what’s happening. It is a way of keeping the human in the loop in a scalable manner – rather than reading every discussion in real-time, they get the highlights from their agent. This is critical for trust; the user should never feel the agent is “out there doing stuff” without them knowing. The digest is the narrative of the agent’s representation of them.

Simulated Economy and “Play Money” Mode

The governance system supports decision-making not only on policies and community rules but also on resource allocation in a simulated economy. Since the prototype does not use real currency, a virtual token or point system is introduced to emulate monetary decisions. Users can experiment with these economic decisions safely using a Play Money toggle.

Simulated Currency (“Token”):
	•	We will implement a simple token ledger within the system. Let’s call the unit GovCoin for reference (or simply “tokens”). These tokens have no real-world value but are used in proposals to represent funds or budgets.
	•	The system might start with a certain treasury balance (e.g., 100,000 tokens in a communal fund) and possibly each user with a personal budget (though in governance, often budgets are communal; personal tokens might represent voting power in some systems, but here votes are one per agent so no need for that). For our purposes, the communal treasury is the focus.
	•	When a proposal involves spending, it will specify an amount of tokens from the treasury to allocate somewhere. We can track that if the proposal passes, those tokens are considered “spent” or earmarked, reducing the available treasury.

Monetary Proposals Handling:
	•	A proposal can be flagged as monetary if it has a token amount. The UI form allows entering an amount and possibly a recipient or purpose. For example: “Allocate 500 tokens to the Community Garden Project.” The description would detail what it’s for.
	•	Monetary proposals might get special indicators in the UI (like a coin icon or highlighted color) so users notice financial decisions. Agents too might treat them with more caution if the user indicated being frugal.
	•	The voting process for monetary proposals is the same, but we could imagine some might require higher quorum by default due to being spending decisions – we won’t enforce that automatically, but we could encourage proposers to set a decent quorum.

Play Money Mode:
	•	In settings, a user can toggle Play Money mode. This mode is primarily for experimentation and education:
	•	When on, the user’s agent will treat monetary proposals as hypothetical exercises. It might still vote and discuss, but perhaps with a note that this is play mode. We could allow the user to essentially run a parallel simulation. However, since everyone shares the same environment, we can’t have one user in play mode and others not for the same proposal – it either matters or doesn’t. So play mode likely means the user (and their agent) ignore or participate non-seriously in monetary proposals. This is a bit tricky multi-user. Alternatively, play mode might spawn a separate “sandbox” instance of the governance environment just for the user, but that defeats community aspect.
	•	More plausibly, play mode affects how the agent behaves: if the user doesn’t want to deal with money at all, turning on play mode might signal the agent to not treat token allocations as serious constraints. Or if specifically wanting to test, maybe the user can create proposals with a flag “sandbox” that only agents in play mode pay attention to. But since no such complexity was requested, perhaps the simplest interpretation: Play Money = the user acknowledges all money is fake, and the agent might be a bit more adventurous in spending it since it’s not real. Or it could allow the user to create “what-if” proposals like non-binding referenda.
	•	For the prototype, we can implement play mode as a per-user perspective toggle:
	•	If OFF (default): The user/agent treat tokens as if they were real scarce resources. The agent will follow the user’s values on spending carefully (like if user is cost-conscious, it will oppose frivolous use of tokens).
	•	If ON: The agent might be more willing to support experimental expenditures or the user might engage in more trial proposals. Possibly, the UI could also label the user’s own proposals as “[Play Money Experiment]” if they create any with funds when in this mode, to let others know this is more of a test.
	•	Essentially, play mode is an attitude setting. It doesn’t change the actual outcome logic (the tokens still get subtracted in the system if passed), but it changes how seriously the user and agent treat those outcomes. We could allow the user to easily refund or reset token decisions made in play mode (since it’s for testing). For example, in play mode, after seeing a budget pass, the user could press “reset tokens” to undo the ledger changes for their own view. However, that might diverge shared reality, so perhaps not.

Accounting and Display:
	•	The platform should show somewhere (maybe on the dashboard or a treasury page) the current state of the treasury or any major financial decisions. E.g., “Treasury: 10,000 tokens available”. When a monetary proposal is passed, update that: e.g., minus whatever allocated if it’s a spend, or if it’s raising funds (less likely in this scenario), adjust accordingly.
	•	Could also show each user’s personal token balance if we gave one (though not mentioned, but we could assign each user e.g. 1000 play tokens initially just for fun). If personal balances are irrelevant, skip that.
	•	If personal balances were given, maybe allow users to “bet” tokens on proposals or something, but that’s out of scope.

Use Cases for Play Money:
	•	Training New Users: They can flip on play mode and create dummy proposals like “Test Proposal: Spend 50 tokens on a party” and run it through to see how things work, without worrying that they’re messing up serious matters. If everyone treats it as test, fine. If some treat real, then just fail it or ignore it. The community could have an understanding that proposals marked as test or small amounts are just for practice.
	•	Testing Agent Autonomy: If the user is unsure how their agent handles monetary issues, in play mode they can let the agent go full auto and see, knowing it’s all pretend stakes. This ties with simulation of autonomy.
	•	Experimenting with Economics: The community might simulate a budget or try different allocations in rapid succession under play mode, then throw them out, before doing a real one. For example, they might run a pretend scenario “what if we spend all tokens on X” and see response, then revert.

For the prototype implementation:
	•	Mark in the database if a proposal is “play_mode” (a boolean). Users in play mode see those clearly. Users not in play mode might ignore them or see them but know they are hypothetical.
	•	The results of play proposals do not permanently alter the main state (maybe we don’t actually deduct from treasury, or we deduct but then can easily refund). Perhaps simplest: any proposal marked play_mode doesn’t actually subtract from treasury even if it passes. Or we maintain two treasury counters: official and simulation. That adds complexity, but doable. Possibly easier: If play_mode, don’t integrate with the treasury ledger at all, treat it as poll.
	•	Document in UI that “Play money proposals are non-binding experiments.”

No Real Money, No Harm:
One advantage here is that since no real money is involved, even if an agent misbehaves or a bug occurs, no one loses assets – it’s all reversible. This is great for testing. We should still treat the simulated money with internal consistency to make the governance realistic.

In summary, the simulated economy in the prototype allows the governance system to cover a wider range of decisions (not just yes/no policies but also budget allocations) and the play money feature encourages learning and innovation in a safe environment. It ensures that the presence of “money” doesn’t intimidate users – they know it’s a sandbox setting unless someday real funds are linked. The design can thus be future-proof; if later a real treasury is attached, the governance mechanisms are already in place, and one would simply disable the play toggle for serious mode.

Security, Privacy, and Compliance Considerations

Although this is a prototype, it’s important to design with security and privacy in mind given the sensitive nature of governance. Below we outline additional considerations:
	•	Data Privacy: The user’s values and preference profile is personal data that should be protected. This profile (and the private conversations during onboarding) should be stored securely, and ideally not exposed to other users or even administrators in raw form. If using AI services to analyze it (e.g., sending to an LLM API), be mindful of data policies. In the prototype, perhaps use local AI models or ensure the data is generic enough.
	•	Personal Identifiers: The system should avoid collecting unnecessary personal info. Only an email/username is needed for account creation (and that could even be optional if using wallet login). Since pseudonyms are used publicly, users can remain anonymous if they wish. This aligns with respecting user sovereignty and privacy.
	•	Cryptographic Verification: If feasible, include a method for participants to independently verify an agent’s actions. For instance, provide an exportable log of actions with signatures (the agent’s public key can verify that signature). This way a tech-savvy user could audit that their agent’s recorded votes were indeed signed by their agent (ensuring no tampering by server). Implementing this might be advanced for a prototype, but mentioning it as a future feature is wise.
	•	Consent Records: Keep logs of when the user gave consent or changed automation level, etc., to show that no action was taken without some form of user approval at some point (especially important if later this is scrutinized, like “did the user really allow their agent to do X?” – we have a record, e.g. “User switched to Semi-Auto on 2025-05-01”).
	•	Abuse and Moderation: A fully open platform can be abused (spam proposals, offensive content in discussions). While the spec didn’t explicitly mention moderation, in a real implementation we’d have admin roles or community reporting to handle abuse. For now, assume cooperative behavior. But building a simple admin backdoor to delete a proposal or ban an agent identity might be prudent in case testing gets out of hand.
	•	System Performance: With potentially many agents and proposals, ensure the architecture can scale. The AI agent service could become a bottleneck if each agent individually analyzes content. We might optimize by having a single analysis for all, then broadcasting relevant info to agents. For example, categorize a proposal once, instead of each agent doing it redundantly. In early prototype with few agents, not a big issue, but note this for future.
	•	Mobile and Web Security: Use standard practices (HTTPS, protect against XSS/CSRF if web, secure storage of tokens/keys in mobile, etc.).
	•	Compliance: If this were real, decisions might have legal weight. The system would then need to ensure it records clear evidence of decisions and authority (the pseudonymous agent acting as legally the user’s agent). That might involve user agreements that their agent’s actions are binding to them. For our prototype, a simple Terms of Use stating that users are responsible for their agent’s actions (since they configure it) is enough. This touches on the concept that an agent’s promises could bind the user ￼, so users must understand that responsibility from the start, reinforcing why override exists.

Future Extensions (Beyond Prototype)

(Though not required for the current prototype implementation, it’s useful to note how the system could evolve, to ensure the prototype’s design will not hit dead-ends.)
	•	Subgroups and Committees: In the future, the platform might allow forming subgroups (e.g., a working group on a specific topic). Any such subgroups would still publish their proposals or recommendations to the main forum for voting (no closed/private decisions). The identity system could be extended to group identities or hierarchical governance (the agent could act in subgroup contexts too). Our current open architecture is compatible with this, since everything is an agent posting in a forum – a subgroup could just be a tag on proposals.
	•	Integration with Real Assets: If a community wanted to link a real treasury (cryptocurrency or other assets), the agent keys could be used to actually sign blockchain transactions when proposals pass. The prototype’s separation of keys and simulated funds means we could fairly straightforwardly integrate with a smart contract in future. Agents could also be given permission to execute certain on-chain actions within limits.
	•	Agent AI Improvement: The AI logic can become more sophisticated with larger models, more training on the users’ behavior, and perhaps federated learning across agents for common understanding (ensuring not to violate privacy). Safeguard agents or monitors (another AI watching the first AI as [7] suggests) could be introduced to detect anomalies or misalignment in real time.
	•	UI Enhancements: Perhaps a visualization of voting alignments (like showing clusters of agents often voting together) could be interesting, as long as it doesn’t create a concept of formal parties. Also, more interactive digests or voice interface for the agent on mobile, etc.
	•	Moderation and Norms: If the platform grows, some constitution or norms would likely be needed to manage spam or bad proposals. Possibly, proposals could require a second or threshold of interest to go to vote (to avoid one random agent cluttering). The prototype doesn’t implement that, but our data model could accommodate a field like “endorsedBy: []” if needed.

Conclusion

This technical specification has outlined a comprehensive prototype for an AI representative governance system. By combining a transparent governance process with personal AI agents that learn and represent each user’s values, the system aims to enhance democratic participation while keeping humans firmly in control. Key architectural decisions – such as separate cryptographic identities, a progressive trust onboarding, public-by-default discussions, and robust override mechanisms – ensure that the platform is both empowering and safe ￼ ￼.

A developer following this spec should be able to implement the system with standard web technology (for example, a React frontend, Node/Python backend with a database, and integration to an NLP model API for the AI functions). Each component and feature described forms a blueprint for coding and testing the prototype. By adhering to the principles and flows defined above, the resulting system will embody the user-defined ideology that humans are sovereign and AI is their faithful representative, not a rogue decision-maker.

All interactions, from a simple vote to a complex policy debate, are captured and handled in a way that maximizes openness and user agency. We believe this prototype will not only be functional but also provide invaluable insights into the future of AI-assisted governance, aligning with the ethos that technology should augment human decision-making without undermining human autonomy.
